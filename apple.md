Please avoid creating a new desktop when making an App fullscreen. It's NOT necessary and make it SLOW to switch between apps. Please at least provide an boolean switch so that user can configure it via CLI, etc. Or change the the default behavior so that making an App fullscreen won't have the side effect of creating a new desktop.
